Basic Instructions:
- Move the sliders to your preferred settings and then hit Reset Simulation in order to set those settings. 
- To kill packets you may just click on them as they traverse across the board.
- My source code only consists of three files. As long as you have them in the same directory, my simulation should run on any browser.
